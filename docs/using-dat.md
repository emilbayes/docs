# Using Dat

This file will have a few small examples of how to use Dat with the various tools (web, desktop, cli?).

The goal is to introduce a new user to Dat and it's key features without making them go through a lengthy install process.

Ideas:

* Download a file (this doc file?) with dat.land
* Share a file to self with dat.land
* Move files from one platform to another (e.g. web -> desktop)
